# Cloudflare LeadScroll

A self-hosted, Cloudflare-native CRM for teams handling inbound leads. It stores data in D1, serves a React workbench from Workers, and exposes a documented API for trusted form integrations.

## Alpha scope

- Leads, notes, custom fields, and a table work queue.
- JSON custom fields stored on each lead, with no definition registry.
- Email + password staff authentication (Better Auth, D1-backed sessions) and revocable API (displayed-once) plus browser (embeddable) intake tokens.
- Idempotent, atomic `POST /v1/intakes` capture for websites and other trusted systems.

Companies, tasks, email sync, imports, reporting, workflows, custom objects, and multi-tenancy are deliberately not included yet.

## Install on Cloudflare

Every deployment is independent: the repo carries no account-specific values.

### Installation repository

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/leadscroll/leadscroll/tree/main/templates/cloudflare)

1. Click the button to copy only [`templates/cloudflare`](templates/cloudflare)
   into a new repository in your GitHub account and connect it to Cloudflare.
   Cloudflare's copy omits `.github/workflows`; the copied README offers a
   one-time link to install the small Upgrade workflow.
2. Use **build command `pnpm run build`** and **deploy command
   `pnpm run deploy`**. The first deploy creates or resolves the named D1 database,
   applies migrations, and deploys the Worker; later deploys reuse it.
3. In the Worker's **Settings → Variables and Secrets**, set
   `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `SETUP_TOKEN`, then redeploy before using the app.

Your generated repository owns only installation configuration; every build
compiles LeadScroll from the exact full source SHA recorded in `leadscroll.json`.
Ordinary rebuilds repeat the recorded revision. For manual upgrades, install
the tiny workflow from your copied repository's
[README](templates/cloudflare/README.md#upgrade-leadscroll) once, then use its
Upgrade button. The workflow validates a candidate from upstream `main` and
commits only the exact `leadscroll.json` source pin. Cloudflare then builds that
revision using the existing Worker and `DB` binding. The README also retains
manual pin-edit instructions and recovery cautions.

No GitHub Release package or publishing token is involved. See [source-built
installations](docs/source-built-installations.md) for pinning, migration
compatibility, and converting an existing full-source snapshot without replacing
its database.

The template leaves both secrets empty. Generate separate random values for `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -base64 32`) and `SETUP_TOKEN` (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Generate these once per installation and keep them across redeployments. The auth URL is detected automatically from the incoming request; there is no URL field to fill in.

After the first deploy, open the app, switch to sign-up, and create the first account using the invite token (`SETUP_TOKEN`). Registration is invitation-only by design: the bootstrap token creates the first account, and every later account requires a single-use invite that an authenticated staff member creates with `POST /v1/invites`. Only invited staff can create an account or reach data.

### Manual install from source

Prerequisites: a Cloudflare account, Node.js 24.20.0 (see `.node-version`) and pnpm 10.34.5. Install the pinned pnpm version using `npm install --global pnpm@10.34.5` if needed.

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
2. Create the D1 database in your account with any name you like — it does not need to match the Worker, for example `pnpm exec wrangler d1 create leadscroll-db`. Copy the `database_id` it prints into the `d1_databases` entry in `wrangler.jsonc` (replacing the empty string) and set `database_name` to the same name you used.
3. Set the session secret: `openssl rand -base64 32 | pnpm exec wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
4. Set the invite token: `openssl rand -hex 32 | pnpm exec wrangler secret put SETUP_TOKEN`. Keep it across redeployments.
5. Deploy: `pnpm run deploy` (set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` if your wrangler login spans multiple accounts). The deploy script builds, applies the D1 migrations, and deploys. The migration also bootstraps the default workspace row (fixed id, `INSERT OR IGNORE`) — the app itself never seeds data per request, so a deleted bootstrap row is not resurrected. Migration commands reference the `DB` binding rather than a database name, so renamed databases keep working.

You can also connect the repository in the dashboard under Workers → Settings → Builds, with the deploy command set to `pnpm run deploy`.

Open the deployed app, switch to sign-up, and create the first account using
the `SETUP_TOKEN` invite token. Registration stays invitation-only: the
bootstrap token creates the first account only, and adding staff means
creating a single-use invite with `POST /v1/invites` from an authenticated
staff session. Only invited staff get data access.

Both `src/worker-global.ts` (the configured deployment entry) and the compatibility
entry `src/worker.ts` use the same app compiled at module scope.

Missing or old template-placeholder session secrets fail authentication closed.
An empty `SETUP_TOKEN` disables bootstrap-token registration only: active,
unused, unexpired staff invites stay redeemable, so revoke those too in order to
stop all new registrations. Production also rejects invite tokens shorter than
32 characters after trimming whitespace; this does not disable existing accounts or sign-in. The bootstrap token is usable until the first account
exists, and staff invite tokens are single-use; rotate `SETUP_TOKEN` if it
leaks.

A fresh deployment operates in bootstrap mode: sign-up is gated by
`SETUP_TOKEN` alone and every authenticated session is treated as staff.
Once the first account exists, the bootstrap grant is no longer available and
new staff accounts are created exclusively through single-use invites.

A fresh deployment also gets a one-time setup window: the migration seeds the
bootstrap grant with a 7-day expiry (`bootstrap_state`, fixed id `default`),
and the grant is consumed the moment the first account is created. Existing
installations gain access at upgrade because the same migration marks the
grant consumed when a user already exists, so nothing about the previous
sign-in flow changes for them. Audit the `bootstrap_state` row before
deploying if you are upgrading an installation you did not build.

If that one-time window expires before the first account is created, the
bootstrap token stops accepting sign-ups. Recovery is operator-only and
narrow on purpose: extend the window only for an unused grant, never reset
consumption, and never expose a public reset path. Run this against the D1
binding, replacing `<DB>` with your configured binding name:

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler d1 execute <DB> --remote --command \
  "UPDATE bootstrap_state SET expires_at = strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', 'now', '+7 days') WHERE id = 'default' AND consumed_at IS NULL AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user);"
```

The `WHERE` clause refuses to touch a grant that was already consumed or a
database that already has an account, so the command is a no-op on a
healthy installation. Rotate `SETUP_TOKEN` in the same change if the
original value leaked.


### Adding staff

Staff accounts are created through single-use invites, not an email allowlist.
From an authenticated staff session, send `POST /v1/invites` with a
`{ name }` body (and an optional `expiresAt`, defaulting to 7 days); the
response contains the raw invite token exactly once. Share it with the new
staff member and have them sign up with it as the `x-setup-token` header on
`POST /api/auth/sign-up/email`:

```sh
curl https://crm.example.com/api/auth/sign-up/email \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-setup-token: <invite-token>' \
  --data '{ "name": "New Staff", "email": "new@company.com", "password": "a-strong-password" }'
```

An invite is redeemed once and marked used automatically at sign-up; while it
is still available it can be listed (by 12-character prefix only) or revoked
with `DELETE /v1/invites/:id`.


### API tokens

Intake API tokens are created in **Settings → Tokens**. A token expires 90
days after creation by default: pass `expiresAt` as a future ISO-8601 date to
pick another time, or `null` to create a token that never expires (handy for a
long-lived browser embed). A token's raw value is returned exactly once, at creation,
inside the dialog; the list only ever shows the 12-character prefix. Revoke a
token with `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id` or the Revoke action in the list. An
expired or revoked token returns `401 unauthorized` on use.

Invitations follow the same display-once rule with a 7-day default expiry,
and they can be used, expired, revoked, or still active — the list shows each
state and hides Revoke only for already-revoked rows.

### Managing staff accounts

`GET /v1/staff` lists every staff account as the public projection
(`id`, `name`, `email`, `disabledAt`); it never returns passwords, hashes,
tokens, or session material. `PATCH /v1/staff/:id` with
`{ "disabled": true }` disables an account: the durable disabled flag and the
deletion of all of that account's sessions commit in one D1 transaction, so
a disabled account's existing sessions are rejected immediately and sign-in
with its credentials is denied until the account is re-enabled. Re-enabling
with `{ "disabled": false }` restores the account's credentials; previously
issued sessions stay revoked, so the account must sign in again. An account
cannot disable itself, and the last enabled account cannot be disabled; both
return `409 conflict`. Unknown ids return `404 not_found`, and both endpoints
require an authenticated staff session.

### Managing your own account

Account (above Sign out) is the self-service surface for the signed-in staff
member: display name, password, and active sessions.

The name change goes through `POST /api/auth/update-user` with a validated
`{ "name" }` body (1–200 characters after trimming); anything else — an
`email` field included — is rejected with `422`. Email addresses cannot be
changed on this deployment: there is no email-sending infrastructure to
verify a new address, and authorization and activity attribution use email. An administrator can
invite a replacement account and disable the old one; identity and history
are not transferred.

The password change goes through `POST /api/auth/change-password`, which
requires the current password, enforces the same 8–255 character policy as
sign-up, and is rate limited (3 attempts per 10 seconds per client address).
A successful change revokes every other session of the account and re-issues
the caller's session cookie, so other devices must sign in again with the
new password.

Sessions are listed at `GET /v1/account/sessions` as
(`id`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, `ipAddress`, `userAgent`, `current`) —
never the session token, which is a bearer-equivalent secret. This guarantee
applies to this list, not upstream Better Auth responses. Revoke one
with `DELETE /v1/account/sessions/:id` (the current session refuses with
`409`; use sign out instead) or all others at once with
`POST /v1/account/sessions/revoke-others`. All three require an
enabled staff session and trusted-origin writes like the rest of the
staff API. Unknown or foreign session ids return `404`; individual success is
`204`. The bulk response counts active sessions removed and keeps the caller.

### Optional auth URL override

By default, authentication uses the origin of each incoming Worker request, so a
new `workers.dev` address or a directly connected custom domain needs no extra
configuration. Production requires HTTPS. Only the resolved origin is trusted;
forwarded host/protocol headers do not change it. This assumes Cloudflare routes
the public request directly to the Worker.

To pin a canonical origin, or if a proxy rewrites the request URL, set the optional
`BETTER_AUTH_URL` variable to an absolute origin such as `https://crm.example.com`
(no path, query, or fragment). Add it to `vars` in your fork's `wrangler.jsonc` and
deploy. It is not a secret and is deliberately absent from the installer prompts.
When set, it takes precedence over request inference; use the app at that origin.
An invalid override fails authentication closed instead of falling back. Existing
installations with `BETTER_AUTH_URL` stored as a secret can keep it, or remove it
to enable automatic detection.

### Local development

Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars`, fill in `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and
`SETUP_TOKEN` using the generation commands above, and add
`ENVIRONMENT=development` to `.dev.vars` to allow local HTTP. Run
`pnpm run db:migrate:local`, then `pnpm run dev:worker` and open the URL it prints.
Enter the invite token on the sign-up screen to create a throwaway account;
sessions are stored in local D1.
Optionally add `DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL` to bypass the session check locally. Development
settings are deliberately absent from `.dev.vars.example`, whose entries become
installer prompts. Deployed configuration stays `ENVIRONMENT=production`.

## Integration API

Create an **API** intake token in **Settings → Tokens**, then send an
idempotent form submission. One submission creates one lead:

```sh
curl https://crm.example.com/v1/intakes \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer lsc_…' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: a-stable-submission-id' \
  --data '{
    "source": "website_form",
    "email": "alex@example.com",
    "firstName": "Sam",
    "customFields": { "segment": "Enterprise" }
  }'
```

A machine-readable OpenAPI document is planned; the routes below are the contract.

### Public intake (browser forms)

Create a **browser** token in **Settings → Tokens** and embed it in the site.
Browser tokens are safe to expose: they can only create leads through
`POST /v1/public/intakes/:token`, which answers CORS preflight so a browser can
post directly. No session or `Authorization` header is required; an optional
`Idempotency-Key` header makes retries safe.

```js
await fetch(`https://crm.example.com/v1/public/intakes/${publicToken}`, {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    customFields: { form: 'pricing', plan: 'pro' },
    email: 'alex@example.com',
    firstName: 'Sam',
    source: 'pricing_form',
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Idempotency-Key': crypto.randomUUID(),
  },
  method: 'POST',
});
```

Leads created this way record the request `Origin` and the public key, shown on
the lead detail. Revoking the token stops it immediately, and the global bulk
soft delete is the spam cleanup.

### Browser SDK

The CRM serves a small, dependency-free SDK at `/sdk/v1.js`. Give a form a
`data-leadscroll` attribute with the browser token and the SDK handles the submit:

```html
<form data-leadscroll="lsc_pub_…">
  <input name="email" type="email" data-leadscroll-collect required>
  <input name="company" data-leadscroll-collect>
  <input name="plan" data-leadscroll-collect value="pro">
  <input name="password" type="password"> <!-- unmarked: never sent -->
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
  <p data-leadscroll-status></p>
</form>
<script src="https://crm.example.com/sdk/v1.js" defer></script>
```

- **Only marked fields are sent.** Add `data-leadscroll-collect` to each
  control, or to an ancestor such as a `<fieldset>` to mark everything inside.
  Unmarked named controls are never transmitted, and the SDK logs a console
  warning listing them.
- `email`, `firstName`/`first_name`/`first-name`, `lastName`, and `source`
  map to lead fields; every other marked input lands in `customFields`, and
  repeated names (checkbox groups, multi-selects) become arrays.
- The endpoint origin comes from the script's own `src`, so the form can live
  on any site. No cookies or credentials are sent.
- Attribute overrides: `data-leadscroll-source`, `data-leadscroll-success`,
  `data-leadscroll-error`, `data-leadscroll-reset="false"`.
- Status text renders into `[data-leadscroll-status]`; the form also dispatches
  `leadscroll:success` and `leadscroll:error` custom events.
- `window.LeadScroll.submit(token, data, { idempotencyKey })` posts
  programmatically, and `window.LeadScroll.init(root)` binds forms added after
  load (for example after client-side navigation).
- Password inputs and credential/payment autocomplete fields (`cc-*`,
  `current-password`, `new-password`, `one-time-code`) are never sent, even when
  marked, and names starting with `_` are skipped by convention.
- Every skipped field is reported: the browser console gets a one-time warning
  naming the fields, and the form dispatches a bubbling `leadscroll:skipped`
  event whose `detail.fields` is a list of `{ name, reason }` (names only, never
  values) — useful for surfacing a forgotten marker in monitoring.
- Skipped fields are also recorded on the lead: the submission carries
  `skippedFields` (names and reasons only), and the lead detail shows a notice,
  so the form owner sees a forgotten marker without wiring up a listener.
  Transmitted diagnostics are capped at 50 names of 120 characters (the intake
  contract); the console warning and the event keep the complete list.
- A failed submission keeps its idempotency key: resubmitting an unchanged form
  retries the same submission instead of creating a duplicate, and overlapping
  submits are ignored while one is pending.

### Intake idempotency contract

Send `Content-Type: application/json`. Every intake body is byte-limited before
decoding; unsupported or missing media types return `415 unsupported_media_type`
when within the limit, and oversized bodies return 413 regardless of media type.

`skippedFields` is optional browser-SDK diagnostics: a bounded array of
`{ name, reason }` entries (`reason` is `sensitive` or `unmarked`) naming fields
the SDK refused to send. Values are never included; the lead detail surfaces the
list.


`POST /v1/intakes` and `POST /v1/public/intakes/:token` share the size limit:
the raw request body is bounded to **65,536 actual bytes** (enforced on the streamed body, with or
without a declared `Content-Length`) before JSON parsing. Larger bodies get
`413 payload_too_large` and write no intake data.

The limit is owned by the intake routes themselves, not by the Worker entry:
a route-local Elysia `parse` hook reads the streamed body with
[`get-stream`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/get-stream)
(`getStreamAsArrayBuffer`, `maxBuffer: 65_536` bytes), then decodes it with a
standard `TextDecoder` and `JSON.parse`. Because the hook is attached to the
route, every accepted alias (`/v1/intakes`, `/v1/intakes/`, and the
normalized `/v1/intakes/.`) enforces the identical byte limit, and the limit
applies before token and idempotency checks. On overflow `get-stream` throws
`MaxBufferError` and cancels the still-open input stream (its async iteration
also releases the reader lock); the route `error` hook maps that one error
type to the `413 payload_too_large` response and never returns or logs the
error instance, which carries the raw submitted bytes. Malformed JSON keeps
Elysia's ordinary `400` handling. Unsupported media types return 415 after
the same bounded read; they never fall through to another body parser.

- **Keys.** `Idempotency-Key` is required and must be 1-128 printable ASCII
  characters (`0x21`-`0x7E`, no spaces). A missing key returns
  `400 idempotency_key_required`; any other malformed key returns
  `400 invalid_idempotency_key`. Both are rejected before any intake data is
  written, as are unauthorized requests.
- **Identity.** The key is workspace-scoped and outlives tokens: rotating or
  revoking tokens never duplicates a submission. Each accepted key stores a
  deterministic SHA-256 fingerprint of the decoded request. The fingerprint
  sorts object keys recursively, preserves array order, and normalizes the
  email (case/whitespace), so JSON whitespace, property order, and email case
  never create a conflict. Omitted versus explicitly supplied optional values
  are fingerprinted differently and may legitimately conflict; use one stable
  form per logical submission.
- **Replay.** Re-sending the same logical payload returns the original `201`
  response and IDs without updating leads or inserting history.
- **Conflicts.** A different payload under the same key returns
  `409 idempotency_conflict` without exposing the stored payload or hash.
  Concurrent same-key calls settle to one persisted winner; identical
  concurrent retries all return the original success.
- **Legacy keys.** Keys accepted before fingerprints existed (null
  `request_hash`) return `409 idempotency_legacy_unverifiable`. Reconcile
  them against the already stored lead (its ID is returned in `details`)
  before considering another submission or key. The stored row is never
  overwritten, backfilled from the new request, or deleted, and blind new-key
  retries are not a substitute for reconciliation.
- **Atomicity.** The lead, its intake activity, and the idempotency key commit
  in one D1 transaction. A failed transaction reserves no key, so the same key
  can be retried after a transient failure.

### Leads

`GET /v1/leads` is keyset (seek) paginated over `createdAt DESC`, tie-broken
by `id DESC`:

- `limit` bounds a page to an integer between 1 and 100 (default 50).
  Non-numeric or out-of-range values return `422 validation_error`.
- `cursor` takes the opaque `nextCursor` from a previous response - a
  base64url-encoded keyset of the last row's `createdAt` and `id` over the
  ordering above. Omit it for the first page; the final page returns
  `nextCursor: null`. A missing, malformed, or tampered cursor returns
  `422 invalid_cursor`.
- `query` is a literal substring match on first name, last name, or email
  (`%` and `_` match literally) and composes with pagination.
- Items carry a `duplicateCount` hint: how many other live leads share the
  normalized email, computed for the whole page in one grouped query.
- Custom fields live in each lead's `customFields` JSON document; there is no
  definition registry, so any key the sender supplies is stored as-is.

`POST /v1/leads` creates a lead manually. At least one of `email`,
`firstName`, or `lastName` is required (`422 lead_identity_required`),
`estimatedValue` must be a non-negative finite number, and the display label
derives from `firstName`/`lastName` with `email` as the fallback. `PATCH /v1/leads/:id`
updates one lead; `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName` accept `null` to clear.
Unknown or soft-deleted ids return `404 not_found`.

`POST /v1/leads/bulk-delete` soft-deletes up to 100 ids: rows stay in D1 with
`deletedAt` set, disappear from `GET /v1/leads`, and keep their activity
history. That is the spam workflow: select rows in the table and delete them.

Consistency while paging: each page is evaluated as of its own query (no
snapshot spans pages). Pages are disjoint windows of the keyset ordering, so
a row is never returned on two pages, and a pass over an unchanged dataset
returns every matching row exactly once. If rows change while a client pages:
a row deleted after its page was served is skipped (it never reappears); a row
inserted after the current cursor position may surface in a later page; a row
inserted before the cursor - newer timestamps, the usual case - sorts ahead of
it and is only visible after restarting from the first page.

### Lead activity

`GET /v1/leads/:id/activities` lists a lead's activity newest first;
`POST /v1/leads/:id/activities` adds a note. Activities belong to a lead;
there is no separate contact or opportunity record.

## Observability

Every API request (`/health`, `/v1/*`, `/api/auth/`, and `/api/invites/`) emits exactly one JSON log line, written synchronously before the response is returned (a Workers isolate can be suspended once the response is sent, so logging does not rely on post-response callbacks):

```json
{"event":"request","method":"GET","path":"/v1/leads","status":200,"durationMs":3.42}
```

Fields:

- `event` — `request` for the per-request line; `request.failure` for structured failure lines emitted when a persistence write or a command fails.
- `method` — the HTTP method.
- `path` — the URL pathname (the actual route path, e.g. `/v1/leads/01...`). Query strings are never logged, so the lead search `query` parameter of `GET /v1/leads` does not reach the logs.
- `status` — the final HTTP status of the response.
- `durationMs` — total processing time for the request in milliseconds.

Responses with a 5xx status, and failure lines, are written with `console.error`; everything else uses `console.log`. Failure lines additionally carry `errorClass`, and for persistence failures the database error's class as `errorCauseClass` (the cause message is never logged because it can embed SQL with bound values), or for command defects the error `errorMessage`. Log lines never contain headers, request bodies, tokens, emails, query strings, stacks, or SQL.

## Continuous integration

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) verifies every push and pull request from a clean checkout. Verification uses no cloud credentials and performs no deployment:

1. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` — pnpm pinned by the `packageManager` field, Node from `.node-version`.
2. `pnpm run typecheck`.
3. `pnpm exec vitest run` — includes the Miniflare-backed D1 suites.
4. `pnpm run build`.
5. `pnpm exec wrangler deploy --dry-run` — validates the deployable bundle without authentication.
6. Source-build contract tests and an isolated template upgrade using local D1 and Chromium.
7. The stable source-build command, preserving its source receipt as a CI artifact.

There is no package publication job. Installations compile their pinned commit with
its frozen lockfile, and only the installation owner's deliberate edit advances
that pin.
See [the source installation contract](docs/source-built-installations.md).

## Development

```sh
pnpm run check
pnpm run build
```

`pnpm run check` runs the typecheck and the full test suite; the same gates (plus the build and the deploy dry-run) run in CI.

The public contract is the REST API. Elysia handles HTTP, Effect Schema is the single validation model, and Effect commands contain domain rules. See [`docs/adr`](docs/adr).
